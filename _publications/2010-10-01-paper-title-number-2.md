Bioanalytical and biomedical applications often require nanoparticles that exhibit narrow size distributions and biocompatibility. Here, we demonstrate how different synthesis methods affect gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) monodispersity and cytotoxicity. Using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), we found that the size distribution of AuNPs synthesized with a cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) cap was significantly improved compared to AuNPs synthesized with citrate capping agents. We determined an up to 4× decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the normal distributions of AuNP diameter and up to a 12% decrease in relative standard deviation (RSD). While the CTAC-capped AuNPs exhibit narrow nanoparticle size distributions, they are cytotoxic, which limits safe and effective bioanalytical and biomedical applications. We sought to impart biocompatibility to CTAC-capped AuNPs through a PEGylation-based surface ligand exchange. We developed a unique ligand exchange method driven by physical force. We demonstrated the successful PEGylation using various PEG derivatives and used these PEGylated nanoparticles to further bioconjugate nucleic acids and peptides. Using cell viability quantification, we confirmed that the monodisperse PEGylated AuNPs were biocompatible. Our monodisperse and biocompatible nanoparticles may advance safe and effective bioanalytical and biomedical applications of nanomaterials.
