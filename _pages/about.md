Hello! My name is Shirsha Mukherjee. I am currently a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Oklahoma. I'm studying Math & Physics, and I also love language & music. In the future, I hope to pursue a PhD in physics, but I am still searching for which branch.

At the University of Oklahoma, I have been heavily involved in [President's Community Scholars](https://www.ou.edu/pcs)- a leadership program for undergraduates. You can contact me for more information about that. If you're ever near Oklahoma, stop by the university! You won't regret it.

Research Interests
======
I've conducted research on a wide breath of topics, from biomedical engineering, to engineering education, to gravitational wave analysis. I've recently joined the LIGO Collaboration, and currently I am using [Bayesian statistics](https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12169) to characterize populations of binary-black-hole mergers. 

Very soon, I'll also be doing research in elementary particle physics where I'll be quantifying how well the cross-sectional area can be measured in order to detect top + bottom quarks.
