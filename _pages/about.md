Hello! My name is Shirsha Mukherjee. I am currently a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Oklahoma. I'm studying Math & Physics, and I also love language & music.


Research Interests
======
I've conducted research on a wide breath of topics, from biomedical engineering, to engineering education, to gravitational wave analysis. Currently, I am using [Bayesian statistics](https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12169) to characterize populations of binary-black-hole mergers. 

Very soon, I'll also be quantifying how well the cross-sectional area can be measured in order to detect top + bottom quarks in fundamental physics.
